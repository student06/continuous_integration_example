Feature: Scripted provisioning of target environment
As a developer    I would like a scripted installation of my target environment    so that I can assume the environment will be the same everytime and my deployments will be predictable
 Background:        Given I am sshed into the environment
Scenario: Is Tomcat Running?        When I run "ps -ef | grep tomcat6"        Then I should see "tomcat"
Scenario: Is Java installed?        When I run "java"        Then I should see "Usage: java"
